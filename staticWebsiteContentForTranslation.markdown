# Summary

From June 7th to 13th, up to fifty climbers from all around Sweden will gather for a week of climbing, camping & socialising at the Focksta bouldering area. <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/focksta" target="_blank">Focksta is a big bouldering site between Uppsala and Enköping</a>, featuring more than 300 problems of all levels of difficulty.

We will all camp in a rented field, located just a few minutes walk away from the boulders, right at the edge of the forest. [Details here](#the-camping-area).

The camp is designed around a community tent - a space where we hang out and socialise. You can read [this section](#our-community-space) for details.

It will cost you ### SEK (around 400-500, TBD) to be a member of Camp5. The money collected from memberships is used to cover the global event expenses. Camp5 is a not-for-profit event. We organise this gathering on a voluntary basis, and everyone is welcome to help out!



# What the organiser provides

- Renting the field used as our camping site, making it a private space for the week
- A nice community space. Colourful, comfortable, and social, especially for evenings and nights. A small bar, a space of expression (for workshops, performances, etc), a small sound-system, …
- Bajamajor
- A cozy fireplace near the community tent
- A bit of electricity

**Everything else should be taken care of by the participants**. This means that you will bring your own drinking water and food for the whole week, + taking care of your own garbage.



# Event principles

Camp5 is based on four principles:

- **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_No_Trace" target="_blank">Leave No Trace</a>**: We must leave the environment as we found it.
- **Participation**: Everyone is invited to make Camp5 their event.
- **No business**: No business shall happen at the event: no advertising, no sponsorships, no transactions. And most importantly: **no money!** We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naqEr2-7b7E" target="_blank">make gifts</a> instead :)
- **Self-reliance**: We take good care of our self (and climb at our own risk).



# The camping area

We will camp in this field (photographed here in autumn):

And here is an overview of how the overall camp will potentially be laid-out:

The easiest way to wash ourselves is in the small river (see the bridge on the above picture). Mälaren is about 8km South, and is a more enjoyable place to take a bath if we take the time to go there.

The camp is very close to the boulders:

# Our community space

The community space is at the heart of the Camp5 concept. It will be a colourful, comfortable, and social place, especially for evenings and nights.

The community space is all this together:

- A comfortable, beautiful and rainproof place to sit, lie down, and be.
- A space of expression (for workshops, performances, etc)
- A bar (where all drinks are free and donated by participants)
- A small sound-system

Some inspiration:

A bonfire will be placed near the community tent, and firewood will be purchased for it.
