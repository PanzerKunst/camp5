Camp5 is a gathering of people sharing an interest in movement activities (climbing, acroyoga, flow arts, slackline, etc). On top of that, various artistic expressions are encouraged during the week that we will be spending together. Come and share what you like!

Our campsite on Ã…land is only a few hundred meters away from the <a href="https://27crags.com/crags/kasviken" target="_blank">Kasviken</a> bouldering crag. It is in the forest, by the sea.

It costs 500 SEK (early bird) or 850 SEK (regular price) to participate in Camp5. The money collected from memberships is used exclusively to cover expenses. We organise this gathering on a voluntary basis, and everyone is welcome to help out :)
