From June 11 to 18th, Camp5 will arise for the third time. This event was born as a climbing gathering, but this year we are opening the theme further: acroyoga and flow make their entrance in big letters in the headline. So: acroyogis, flow artists, (as well as slackliners...) of Sweden and beyond, you are invited with open arms to make Camp5 **your** gathering too!

The location will be on Ã…land this year. The campsite is only a few hundred meters away from the <a href="https://27crags.com/crags/kasviken" target="_blank">Kasviken</a> bouldering crag. It is in the forest, by the sea.

It costs 350 SEK (early bird) or 700 SEK (regular price) to participate in Camp5. The money collected from memberships is used exclusively to cover expenses. We organise this gathering on a voluntary basis, and everyone is welcome to help out :)

You can buy your membership here: <a href="http://camp5-2017.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">http://camp5-2017.eventbrite.com</a>. Early bird registrations end on April 16, and regular-priced ones on May 21st.
