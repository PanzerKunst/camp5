Camp5 is a gathering of people sharing an interest in movement activities (climbing, acroyoga, flow arts, slackline, etc).

As a participant, you are invited to <a href="http://www.bit.ly/camp5-projects" target="_blank">contribute to the event</a> – if you want. It can take the form of workshops, music, performance, artwork, games and everything else you love and want to share with others.

Our campsite on Åland is only a few hundred meters away from the <a href="https://27crags.com/crags/kasviken" target="_blank">Kasviken</a> bouldering crag. It is in the forest, by the sea.

It costs 450 SEK (early bird) or 700 SEK (lazy bird) to participate in Camp5. The money collected from memberships is used exclusively to cover expenses. We organise this gathering on a voluntary basis, and everyone is welcome to help out :)
