These checklists aren't exhaustive, but you should be able to survive Camp5 if you follow them :)


### Individual checklist

- Your usual equipment for bouldering / yoga / flow / slacklining
- Tent
- Warm camping bedding (temperature can go down to 7 degrees at night)
- Bathing clothes and towel
- Torch or headlamp
- Ecological soap and shampoo
