### How does membership work?

Camp5 memberships are personal and your name and e-mail address must be in our system for you to participate.

If you cannot attend, you can always transfer your membership to someone else. "Selling" your membership for higher than the price you paid is forbidden, and can lead to its cancellation.

All transfers need to be done on May 21st latest. After this date, our list of participants is final. To transfer a membership, [write us an e-mail](mailto:camp5gathering@gmail.com) with the name and email of the recipient.

Children younger than 13 participate for free. Participants under 18 can only participate in the company of an adult.

By registering yourself as a participant, you agree to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsSc3zXridFHQmNoUsuHzXBURn3vCiFn5CrvMjW3y2w/edit" target="_blank">Event Participation Agreement</a>. 


### Can I come for shorter than the whole week?

Absolutely. But there is only one type of membership, so it costs the same if we participate for one day, or for eight.


### I need help for transport or camping!

In that case we invite you to join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/camp5.rideshares.and.camping.organisation" target="_blank">Rideshares and Camping Organisation</a> Facebook group, and to write a post with what you need help with. Please also join that group if you have the possibility to help, thank you! 


### What is the money from memberships used for?

Camp5 is a not-for-profit event. The money gathered from memberships in used exclusively to cover costs. Nobody is paid anything. After each event, the detailed budget is published in the Facebook group.


### I wish to participate with something which benefits the whole event. Can Camp5 support me financially?

Yes! We can most probably use the Camp5 budget for it. Can you write more details about your project in our Facebook group?
