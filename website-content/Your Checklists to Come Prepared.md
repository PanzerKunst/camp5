These checklists aren't exhaustive, but you should be able to survive Camp5 if you follow them :)


### Individual checklist

- Your usual equipment for bouldering / acroyoga / flow / slacklining
- Tent
- Warm camping bedding (temperatures can go down to 7 degrees at night)
- Bathing clothes and towel
- Torch or headlamp
- Ecological soap and shampoo
- Mosquito repellant


### Checklist for your camp

- Transport to Camp5; by car is the most convenient because youâ€™ll need to bring:
