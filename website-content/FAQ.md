### How does membership work?

Camp5 memberships are personal and your name and e-mail address must be in our system for you to participate.

If you cannot attend, you can always transfer your membership to someone else. "Selling" your membership for higher than the price you paid is forbidden, and can lead to its cancellation.

All transfers need to be done on May 20th latest. After this date, our list of participants is final. To transfer a membership, [write us an e-mail](mailto:camp5gathering@gmail.com) with the name and email of the recipient.

Children younger than 13 participate for free. Participants under 18 can only participate in the company of an adult.

By registering yourself as a participant, you agree to the <a href="http://bit.ly/camp5-epa" target="_blank">Event Participation Agreement</a>. 


### Can I come for shorter than the whole week?

Yes, but starting 2018, the last day to arrive is Thursday. Admission closes on Thursday 19:00.


### I need help for transport or camping!

The easiest is to write about it in the Facebook group. The other participants will try to help as much as possible.


### What is the money from memberships used for?

Camp5 is a radically not-for-profit project. The money gathered from memberships in used exclusively to cover costs. Nobody is paid anything. After each event, the detailed budget is published in the Facebook group.


### I wish to participate with something which benefits the whole event. Can Camp5 support me financially?

Yes!!! Part of the Camp5 budget is dedicated to that purpose. Can you write more details about your project in our Facebook group?
